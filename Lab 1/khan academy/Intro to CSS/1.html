        <p>The <em> Horses </em> are awesome because <strong> they are intelligent, obedient, friendly, understanding, compassionate, even-tempered, loyal, trustworthy, and beautiful. Due to their long life span, you will have a pet that is a part of your life for a long time ( 25 to 30 years.) 
            This makes it possible to develop a very strong bond with it over a prolonged period of time.</strong>.</p>
