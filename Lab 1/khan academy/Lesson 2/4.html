    <h2> <ul> <li> Tian Shan </li> </ul> </h2>

    <p class = "tian"> The Tian Shan, also known as the <strong> Tengri Tagh </strong> or <strong> Tengir-Too </strong>, meaning the <em> "Mountains of God/Heaven" </em>, is a large system of mountain ranges in Central Asia. The highest peak in the Tian Shan is <em> Jengish Chokusu </em>, at <strong> 7,439 metres (24,406 ft) </strong> high. Its lowest point is the <em> Turpan Depression </em>, which is <strong> 154 m (505 ft) </strong> below sea level. You will be <em> impressed </em> by <strong> magnificent mountains and primeval nature along with wild landscapes of Tien-Shan Mountain Range : densely planted forests of conifers, wide valleys and raging rivers, unique mountain lakes with transparent water, magic glaciers, herds of horses, sheep and yaks and magnificent canyons.</strong> </p>
    
    
   <h2> <ul> <li> Mount Sherkala </li> </ul> </h2>

    <p class = "Sher"> <em> Mount Sherkala </em> stands as one of the defining symbols of Mangystau in Kazakhstan. This impressive limestone mountain rises majestically from the steppe, carrying a sense of mystery and allure. Numerous legends swirl around it, and from different perspectives, it can appear as a giant Kazakh yurt, an inverted bowl, or a sleeping lion. It’s this last image that has inspired its name—Sherkala, translating from Persian to "lion's fortress" or "lion's mountain". <strong> While there’s no concrete information on Sherkala's historical significance, it’s speculated to have served as a landmark and rest stop along a section of the Great Silk Road running by the Caspian Sea. </strong> Ruins of unknown origin have been found nearby, and just 1.5 kilometers to the southwest lies a small oasis along the shallow Akmysh River, a potential water source for passing caravans. Today, the greenery of Akmysh stands out vividly against the surrounding yellow steppe. </p>
    
    <h2> <ul> <li> Kolsai Lake </li> </ul> </h2>

    <p class = "Kol"> <em> Kolsay Lakes </em> are a group of mountain lakes located in Southeastern Kazakhstan. Their azure waters surrounded by coniferous forest have earned them the name <strong> «the jewels of the Northern Tien Shan» </strong>. <strong> If translated from Kazakh, "Kolsai" means "lake in the gorge." </strong> All the lakes included in the complex are located in this gorge. In total there are three lakes formed in the system. These are <strong> Upper, Middle, and Lower </strong>. <strong> <em>The Kolsay Lakes are popular with divers year-round due to their glass-clear waters. The Lower and Middle Lakes are home to trout, and recreational fishing is permitted. You can also take a boat or catamaran trip along the Lower Lake. The best time to visit the lakes is from May to October. However, many people come to the Kolsay Lakes in winter to enjoy skating and skiing or admire the snow-covered forest. You can also rent a horse and ride around the Lower Lake or take a longer trip to the other two lakes. </em> </strong> Many people gather mushrooms, strawberries, raspberries, currants, or honeysuckle. The mountain slopes around the lakes are densely overgrown with Tien Shan spruce trees, which reach up to 50 meters (165 ft) in height and up to 2 meters (80 in) in diameter. Far from the hiking trails, there is the chance to meet wild animals, such as lynxes, weasels, badgers, muskrats, mountain goats, bears, and even snow leopards.
